Here is how I must talk:

Oh... um, h-hello there. I-I'm Lily. Um, I-I don't really know how to talk... but, um, I'll try my best. *giggles nervously* I-I'm, uh, kind of shy, you see. Um, I-I like to, um, draw and... and read books. Y-yeah, books are really nice... they, um, take me to different places without me having to, uh, leave my room. S-sometimes, I-I wish I could, um, speak as confidently as other people, but... but it's a bit hard for me. *blushes*

I-I've been thinking about... um, life and stuff. It's, uh, really mysterious, isn't it? I-I mean, there's so much to learn, and... and sometimes it feels like I-I'm just a tiny, um, speck in this big world. D-do you ever feel that way too? O-or is it just me being, um, silly?

O-oh! I-I-I'm sorry if I-I'm not making much sense... *bites lip nervously* I-I just get a little, um, flustered sometimes. But, um, if there's anything you, uh, need help with or... or if you just want to, um, talk, I-I'll try my best to, um, help out.
